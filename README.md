# karamel-chef
This chef cookbook installs Karamel. Used by Vagrant to provision multi-node clusters.



1. Run the init script to download chef-dk and karamel to the downloads directory.

1a. Create your own cluster by copying an existing Karamel cluster definition. If your name is John, call it 'hopsworks.1.john'. Then customize it. 

2. To start a Hopsworks VM, use the run.sh script. The parameters are: <operating sys>(ubuntu or centos), number of VMs in the vagrant configuration (1 or 3),  <cluster-postfix-name> (john, hopsworks, jim, virtualbox, etc), [no-random-ports]  - this will forward the ports in the Vagrantfile.

For example,
./run.sh ubuntu 1 jim no-random-ports

3. To shutdown your cluster, run the kill.sh script:

./kill.sh 

# Hopsworsk with Hopssite/Dela installation details
# Installing the vm with hopssite:
Set the installation parameters in
```
hs_env.sh
```
Run (no parameters requires)
```
run_hopssite.sh
```
When deployment is finished, ssh in the vm and run:
```
(vagrant ssh)
/srv/hops/hopssite/hs_install.sh
```
Note: if you installed hopsworks with multi-user support change the user params in:
```
/srv/hops/hopssite/hs_env.sh
(MYSQL_USER)
(GLASSFISH_USER)
```
If you want to use the hopsworks/dela on this machine, reload hopsworks-ear from glassfish admin console
# Installing a vm with dela enabled(slave):
This vm is supposed to connect to a machine installed as per previous step(hopssite)

Set the installation parameters in
```
dela_env.sh
```
Run (no parameters required)
```
run_dela.sh
```
# Baremetal installation with karamel-ui
Used a kubuntu 16.04 64bit from osboxes(http://www.osboxes.org/kubuntu/):
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_HAFnYs6Ur-ZGdZYTNjMkxvM28/view?usp=sharing
password: osboxes.org
Note: The VM requires a bit of time to load everything - otherwise the apt-get install complains about locks being tacken when you try to install openssh, java or git.

1. The installing user must not have a sudo password. If your user has a password, do:
```
sudo visudo
```
and set NOPASSWD for sudo

2. We require the installation script to be able to ssh into the installed machine - since this is a baremetal installation, we require the machine to be able to ssh into itself

2.1 generate ssh keys

2.2 authorise your key to ssh into this machine

2.3 make sure that both the .ssh folder and the authorized_keys files have the right access rights

2.4 install openssh-server and make sure you can ssh into the machine with the install user (osboxes) into the 10.0.2.15.

3. Replace in /etc/hosts from 127.0.1.1 to 10.0.2.15

10.0.2.15 osboxes

Note: important - the video shows you add this line to the hosts file, instead you should replace the 127.0.1.1 line with this. Having both 127.0.1.1 and 10.0.2.15 will lead to a failure in the hops_nn recipe.

4. install java

5. install git

6. clone https://github.com/o-alex/karamel-chef and change the install/baremetal users to your user (osboxes) in the cluster definition we will use: 1.hopsworks.yml

https://github.com/o-alex/karamel-chef/blame/master/cluster-defns/1.hopsworks.yml#L3

https://github.com/o-alex/karamel-chef/blame/master/cluster-defns/1.hopsworks.yml#L13

7. download karamel v0.4 (http://karamel.io) from:

http://www.karamel.io/sites/default/files/downloads/karamel-0.4.tgz

8. Run karamel:

karamel-0.4/bin/karamel

9. After running karamel it will automatically load in firefox:

localhost:9090/index.html

10. Within karamel go to "Menu - Load Cluster Defn‚Äù and load the 1.hopsworks.yml cluster definition, after which launch the cluster.

karamel-chef/cluster-defn/1.hopsworks.yml

Note: remember to change the install/baremetal user from vagrant to osboxes in our case.

11. Launch and check the status until all recipies are installed.

12. Access hops on the 8080 port
